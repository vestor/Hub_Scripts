Hi there.
These scripts were written to facilitate the actual usage of a hub on a DC++ network. 

They are in no way the most efficient scripts and can have a ton of improvement. 
Keep in mind that these scripts were written over a week's time and can have tons of bugs.

Just drop me a mail @ manish001992@gmail.com if you want use them anywhere, and if not too much trouble mention my nick: "Vestor" somewhere :P

Note: All the script files have to present in the same folder (not separated into different ones; if you are so inclined just change the path names in the scripts)
